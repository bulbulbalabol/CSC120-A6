What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Unit testing helped me check my code in a more organized way. It showed me how useful it is to write tests for small parts of the program. The tests for Car, Passenger, Engine, and Train made sure that my code worked the way I wanted.

At first, I was confused about how to test some methods, like printManifest(), but I learned that I could just test if it runs without errors. I also had to remember to check list sizes with getPassengers().size().

My advice for future students is to test your code step by step. Donâ€™t leave all the tests for the end. Unit testing makes debugging easier and helps you trust your program.
